# FlockingVisualisation
Flocking algorithm visualised in Processing 3

This is a finished prototype of a flocking algorithm being visualised that I completed about a year ago now. As it is a brute force approach to the problem, I am aware that the performance can be majorly improved with techniques such as implementing a quadtree, however I have not attempted doing this yet.
